# Global Chat Project
This project was built for my Capstone in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

## Instructions
1. This app currently supports only one user per phone (device);
2. To run it in the emulator, you must use uno of the following test numbers to log in:
    - +16505554321
    - +16505551234 
    - +16505553434 
3. The app's widget will display the last message received, only if the app is running at least in the backgound;
